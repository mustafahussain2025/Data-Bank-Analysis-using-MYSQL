# Data Bank Analysis using MySQL
# Problem Statement
Neo-Banks are a recent development in the financial sector; they are new banks that solely operate online. Believing there should be a connection between the digital world, these new-age institutions, and cryptocurrencies, I decided to start a new project called Data Bank. Customers of Data Bank receive cloud data storage allotments directly related to their account balances. The Data Bank team needs assistance to tackle intriguing challenges posed by this business model. This case study focuses on metrics calculations, business growth, and smart data analysis to assist the company in more accurately estimating and planning for the future.

# Approach
To answer the key questions, we will use MySQL to query and analyze the provided datasets: Regions, Customer Transactions, and Customer Nodes. The analysis will include:

Counting the total number of nodes in the Data Bank network.
Determining the number of nodes in each region.
Counting the number of customers in each region.
Calculating the total transaction amounts for each region.
Calculating the average time it takes to move clients to a new node.
Counting the unique transactions and total amounts for each transaction type.
Calculating the average number and size of deposits for all customers.
Identifying the number of customers making multiple deposits and at least one purchase or withdrawal per month.
 # Conclusion
This analysis will provide valuable insights into the Data Bankâ€™s operations, customer distribution, and transaction dynamics. By addressing these key questions, we can help the Data Bank team better understand their network structure, optimize their services, and strategically plan for future growth and development. This comprehensive approach will aid in making informed business decisions and improving overall efficiency.
